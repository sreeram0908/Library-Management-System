# Library-Management-System
A terminal based java application that helps to manage books in a library.

A Library Management System created using Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles. This project demonstrates the use of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a modular, maintainable, and efficient system.
The system is designed to handle various tasks such as managing books, members, and administrative operations, with a console-based interface.

The project is implemented in Java with a MySQL database for data storage. It was developed as part of the course "Object Oriented Analysis and Design CS309".
